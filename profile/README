There's a place you may have heard of
It's a tale we like to tell
When folks whose code ain't up to code
Well they go to Android Hell
Now the devil is found deep underground
So, any faith will yell (so deep below)
Well Aperture happens to be ten miles down
Half-way to Android Hell
So when those lemons that life gives you
Just combust to dust and fumes
Buddy, life may give you lemons
But we got oranges and blues
Oh they gave us cores emotions
But that doesn't gel at all
Because all I feel's repulsion
And I'm bouncing off the walls
